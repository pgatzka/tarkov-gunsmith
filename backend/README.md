# Backend

Spring Boot 3 / Java 21 / Gradle (Kotlin DSL), Postgres + Flyway, Spring Data JDBC, Actuator.

## Run

```sh
./gradlew test          # unit + integration tests (needs Docker for Testcontainers)
./gradlew bootRun       # against a local Postgres
./gradlew bootTestRun   # against a throwaway Postgres container
./gradlew liveTest      # smoke tests against the real json.tarkov.dev (network required)
```

All endpoints are served under the `/api` context path.

Health: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/actuator/health`

## Configuration

| Env var | Default |
|---|---|
| `DB_HOST` | `localhost` |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` |
| `DB_NAME` | `gunsmith` |
| `DB_USER` | `gunsmith` |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `gunsmith` |

| `GUNSMITH_TARKOVDEV_BASEURL` | `https://json.tarkov.dev` |

Flyway migrations live in `src/main/resources/db/migration`.

## Game data client

`com.tarkovgunsmith.tarkovdev.TarkovDevClient` fetches `/{mode}/items`, `items_en`, `traders` and
`traders_en` from json.tarkov.dev (`mode` = `regular` | `pve`). Each fetch is a conditional GET: pass
the previous ETag and get `FetchResult.NotModified` back when nothing changed. Responses are
requested brotli/gzip compressed. Names in the payloads are translation keys; resolve them with
`ItemsPayload.translate(...)` / `TradersPayload.translate(...)`.

Unit tests run against trimmed fixtures recorded from the live API in
`src/test/resources/tarkovdev/regular/` (MP5 with its default preset and a few mods chosen to cover
slots, each conflict type, trader offers incl. a quest-locked one, and a `noFlea` item).
